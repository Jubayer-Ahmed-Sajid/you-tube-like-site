            <p class="text-gray-700">null and undefined are two distinct values that are often used in different
                scenarios. Understanding their use cases is important for writing clean and bug-free code.</p>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold">undefined:</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
            <div class="font-semibold">Function Return:</div> Function Return: Functions that don't explicitly return a
            value return undefined by default.
            <div class="font-semibold"> Function Parameters: </div> If a function is called with fewer arguments than
            declared parameters, the missing parameters are undefined.
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold">Null:</h4>
            <div class="font-semibold">Explicit Absence of Value:</div>null is often used to represent an explicit
            absence of any object value or no value. It is a value you can assign to a variable or object property to
            indicate that it's intentionally empty
            <div class="font-semibold"> Resetting Values:</div>You can assign null to a variable or object property to
            "reset" it or indicate that it should no longer reference an object.</p>
            <div class="font-semibold">Function Behavior:</div> Functions may return null to indicate that a value is
            missing or that an operation didn't produce a result.
            <div class="font-semibold">Explicit Check:</div>You can use null for explicit checks in your code to
            indicate that a certain condition has been met or a value is intentionally missing.

            <p class="text-gray-700">var,let and const are three different method declaring variable. These three method
                has three different use case and they have their own scope that is determine from where in your code you
                can access the specific variable. The scope of variable defines the visibility and lifetime of a
                variable. The scope of var, let and const has been discussed below</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">
            <div class="font-semibold">Function Scope:</div> Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means
            they are accessible anywhere within the function where they are declared, including nested functions.
            <div class="font-semibold"> Hoisting:</div> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their
            containing function or global scope. This means you can access a var variable before it's declared in your
            code, but its value will be undefined until it's assigned a value.
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold">const:</h4>
            <div class="font-semibold">Function Scope:</div> const variables are block scooped
            <div class="font-semibold"> Hoisting:</div>const variable are not hoisted.</p>
            <div class="font-semibold">Immutable:</div> Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned once they are
            given a value. However, if a const variable holds an object or array, the properties or elements of that
            object or array can be modified.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 underline">Rest API</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a
                type of web API (Application Programming Interface) that adheres to the principles of REST, which is an
                architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs are commonly used for building web
                services that allow different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet.

            <div class="font-semibold my-4">Here are key characteristics and concepts associated with REST APIs:</div>

            <div class="font-semibold my-2">Resources:</div> In a REST API, resources are the key abstractions. These
            resources are represented by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), and each URL typically corresponds to a
            specific entity or object, such as a user, product, or data record. Resources can be in various formats,
            such as JSON or XML.
            <div class="font-semibold my-2">Resources:HTTP Methods:</div>
            REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. The primary HTTP methods used in
            REST are:

            <div><span class="font-semibold p-4">GET:</span>Retrieve data from the server (read-only).</div>
            <div><span class="font-semibold p-4">POST:</span>Create a new resource on the server.</span></div>
            <div><span class="font-semibold p-4">PUT:</span>Update an existing resource on the server.</span></div>
            <div><span class="font-semibold p-4">DELETE:</span>Remove a resource from the server.</span></div>


            These HTTP methods map to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
            <div class="my-4"><span class="font-semibold "> Statelessness:</span>Each HTTP request to a REST API should
                contain all the information needed for the server to understand and process the request. The server
                doesn't rely on any information from previous requests, making it stateless. Any session or context
                information should be included in the request itself.</span></div>
            <div class="my-4"><span class="font-semibold "> Uniform Interface:</span>REST APIs provide a uniform and
                consistent interface for interacting with resources. This means that the API design is standardized and
                predictable, making it easier for developers to understand and use.</span></div>
            <div class="my-4"><span class="font-semibold "> Representation:</span> Resources in a REST API are
                represented in a format, often JSON or XML, which can be easily understood by both humans and machines.
                Clients can request specific representations (e.g., JSON or XML) using the Accept header in HTTP
                requests.</span></div>
            <div class="my-4"><span class="font-semibold ">
                    Hypermedia (HATEOAS):</span>REST APIs can include links or hypermedia controls within responses,
                allowing clients to discover and navigate available resources and actions dynamically. This is known as
                HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State).</span></div>
            <div class="my-4"><span class="font-semibold "> RStateless Communication:</span>
                Clients and servers in a RESTful architecture communicate via stateless requests and responses. Each
                request from the client to the server should contain all necessary information for processing the
                request, and each response from the server should contain the result of the request.</span></div>
            <div class="my-4"><span class="font-semibold "> Authentication and Authorization:</span> REST APIs often use
                various methods of authentication and authorization to secure access to resources. Common approaches
                include API keys, OAuth, and token-based authentication.</span></div>

            REST APIs are widely used for building web services due to their simplicity, scalability, and flexibility.
            They are commonly used in web and mobile applications to exchange data with remote servers and services.
            When designing or using a REST API, adherence to REST principles and best practices is essential for
            creating well-structured and maintainable APIs.</p>
